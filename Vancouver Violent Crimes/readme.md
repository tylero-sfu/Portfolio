# Vancouver Violent Crimes Prediction

This project analyzes violent crime data in Vancouver to identify seasonal patterns and predict future crime rates using a seasonal ARIMA model. The analysis covers a 10-year period from 2010 to 2020 and explores how external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, influenced crime rates. The best-fitting model, ARIMA(1,1,1)(2,0,0)[12], was selected after diagnosing various models, and the results revealed clear seasonal trends with crime rates peaking in summer months. The model was then used to forecast violent crimes for 23 months beyond the dataset, with a focus on the pandemic's impact on crime rates.
