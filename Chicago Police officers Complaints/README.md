# Prediction of complaints against Chicago Police officers

This project involves predicting complaints against Chicago police officers using data from 2015 to 2016. The analysis incorporates various datasets, including information about accusations, awards, complaints, and salaries. Through feature engineering, we created variables capturing past accusations, awards, salary data, and probationary status.

The primary machine learning techniques used were Random Forest and XGBoost. These models were evaluated using cross-validation and ROC-AUC scores, with Random Forest providing the best performance due to its handling of categorical data. The project addresses challenges such as missing data and the inclusion of categorical and temporal variables.
