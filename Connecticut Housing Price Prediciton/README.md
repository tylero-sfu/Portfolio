# Predictive Modeling for Connecticut Housing Price

This project analyzes real estate data to predict housing sale prices using a combination of numerical and categorical variables. Key variables include the assessed property value, property type, and town-specific market trends. Through extensive feature engineering, missing data handling, and the application of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Lasso Regression, and XGBoost, we aim to capture complex patterns in the data. The best-performing model was XGBoost, optimized through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, achieving the lowest RMSE. The analysis highlights the importance of proper feature selection and data preprocessing in predictive modeling.
