# NBA Statsitics Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes in-game NBA statistics to determine which factors contribute the most to winning games. The analysis uses game data from Kaggleâ€™s NBA database and focuses on key variables such as rebounds, turnovers, field goal attempts, and personal fouls. Various machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting, were applied to predict game outcomes. The analysis highlights that rebounds are the most significant factor in predicting game results, while personal fouls and free throw attempts have minimal impact. The models achieved a validation accuracy of over 81%, providing actionable insights for improving team performance.
