# COVID-19 Data Exploration

This project analyzes the global impact of COVID-19 using SQL. The analysis focuses on COVID-19 infection rates, death rates, and vaccination trends across countries and continents. By querying datasets containing COVID-19 statistics, the project identifies countries with the highest infection and death counts, calculates the percentage of the population affected, and tracks vaccination progress using window functions for rolling calculations. Temporary tables, Common Table Expressions (CTE), and views are employed for structured data management and efficient querying.
