# Broadway Ticket Sales Analysis

This project analyzes 25 years of Broadway ticket sales data to determine the factors affecting total gross revenue. The analysis focuses on show types (musical, play, special) and the number of performances as key predictors.

By using statistical methods such as linear regression, ANOVA, and Tukey tests, the study identifies significant differences in revenue generation based on show type, with musicals outperforming other categories. Data transformation and residual analysis were employed to meet model assumptions and enhance prediction accuracy.
