# Cyber Security

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in electric power consumption data using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The goal was to identify deviations from normal consumption patterns, which may indicate cybersecurity threats such as energy theft, unauthorized access, or meter tampering.

Data preprocessing involved cleaning and feature scaling, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and capture key consumption patterns. The optimal HMM model, with 18 hidden states, was selected based on BIC and log-likelihood metrics. Anomalies were flagged using log-likelihood thresholds, providing a robust framework for real-time anomaly detection in electric power systems.
