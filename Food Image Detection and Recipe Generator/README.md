# DishCovery (https://github.com/sbail01/fruit-app)

DishCovery is a project aimed at reducing food waste by using artificial intelligence to recognize ingredients from refrigerator images and generate recipe suggestions. The project leverages computer vision through models like YOLOv5 for ingredient detection and natural language processing to create recipe suggestions. This AI-driven approach helps users efficiently manage their food inventory while contributing to sustainability efforts. The system was developed using deep learning, image recognition, and user feedback integration to refine accuracy and user experience.
